    <p>
        Sawa Notifications is a Chrome extension designed to display notifications to authenticated users
        based on messages received from the Sawa CRM system.
    </p>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        The extension uses a secure Single Sign-On (SSO) process to authenticate users through the Sawa CRM website
        (https://maxim.bedab.com) and obtain an access token.
        This token is used solely to retrieve notification messages.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        The extension does not collect personal information directly from users.
        Any data accessed from the CRM system is used only to display notifications within the browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Authentication tokens and notification-related data may be stored temporarily using Chrome storage
        to maintain the user session and functionality.
        No personal data is permanently stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The extension uses the following permissions:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>notifications</strong> – to display CRM notifications</li>
            <li><strong>storage</strong> – to store session-related data</li>
            <li><strong>alarms</strong> – to periodically check for new notifications</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        No user data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties.
        All data communication occurs only between the extension and the Sawa CRM system.
    </p>

    <h2>User Consent</h2>
    <p>
        By installing and using this extension, users consent to authentication via the Sawa CRM system
        and receiving notifications generated by it.
